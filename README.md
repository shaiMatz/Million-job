# Million-job
We build a system where unemployed people can look for a job based on their personal details. They could sort the opening jobs by different features: job type,  job area and more, and find their wanted job. Moreover the employer will be able to publish their job opportunities and see the profile of the candidates that applied for the job. Furthermore,  they would be able to search in the database for the best candidates that shared their resume by classifying their fine candidate that fit for the job.
